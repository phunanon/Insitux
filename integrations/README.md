### Integrating Insitux

Include https://www.npmjs.com/package/insitux into your project.

Next is up to you. `index.ts`'s `invoke()` must be supplied with a context you implement, and per invocation given a unique/randomised/incremented invokeId. You can add your own operations to Insitux with the `functions` list.  
Further explanation can be found in the docstring of most functions and types like `invoke`, `Ctx`, `symbols`, etc.
